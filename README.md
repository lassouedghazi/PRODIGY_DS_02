## 📊 Prodigy Info Tech Internship - Task 2: Unveiling Insights from Titanic Data

### 🚀 Introduction
Welcome to my second project at Prodigy Info Tech! Building on my previous experience with data visualization, I'm now diving into the intriguing world of data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) with one of the most iconic datasets in the field of data science—the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. This project is focused on uncovering hidden patterns, exploring relationships between variables, and transforming raw data into meaningful insights.

### 📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset I'm working with is the "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" dataset, which provides detailed information on the passengers aboard the Titanic. This rich dataset is perfect for applying data cleaning techniques and conducting in-depth EDA to understand the factors that influenced survival during the tragic event.

#### Dataset Highlights:
- **Variables:** The dataset includes a variety of categorical and numerical variables such as `Survived`, `Pclass`, `Name`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Ticket`, `Fare`, `Cabin`, and `Embarked`.
- **Objective:** To clean the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis to identify trends, relationships, and potential insights that can guide further analysis or model building.

### 🛠️ Project Goals

#### Data Cleaning:
- **Handling Missing Data:** Address missing values in variables like `Age`, `Cabin`, and `Embarked` to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create new features or modify existing ones to better capture the nuances of the data (e.g., extracting titles from names, categorizing fare prices, etc.).
- **Outlier Detection:** Identify and manage outliers in the data to prevent skewed results.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- **Survival Rates:** Analyze survival rates across different passenger classes, genders, and ages to understand the factors that might have influenced survival.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Explore the relationships between different variables, such as `Fare` and `Pclass`, to identify potential correlations.
- **Visual Storytelling:** Use descriptive statistics and visualizations like bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps to present the findings in a compelling way.

### 💻 Tools and Technologies
To achieve these goals, I will leverage a robust set of data science tools and libraries:

- **Python 🐍:** The cornerstone of this project, providing the flexibility and power needed for data cleaning and EDA.
- **Pandas & NumPy 📊:** Essential libraries for data manipulation, cleaning, and numerical analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn 🎨:** For creating detailed visualizations that bring the data to life.
- **Jupyter Notebook 📓:** To document the analysis process, experiment with different approaches, and share findings interactively.

### 🎯 Deliverables

- **Cleaned Dataset:** A well-prepared dataset with no missing values or outliers, ready for further analysis or modeling.
- **In-Depth EDA Report:** A comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset, highlighting key trends, correlations, and insights derived from the data.
- **Compelling Visualizations:** A series of plots that visually represent the most important findings from the EDA process.

### 🔥 Conclusion
This project represents a critical step in my journey at Prodigy Info Tech, where I aim to master the art of data cleaning and exploratory analysis. By the end of this task, I will not only have a deep understanding of the Titanic dataset but also the skills to uncover valuable insights from any dataset.

Stay tuned for the final results—where raw data is transformed into actionable knowledge!
